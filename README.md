## Overview

This is a simple Airbnb review website using MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Node). On the main page, it lists all Airbnbs from the dataset, allowing users to use the different search functionalities to find the desired Airbnbs. For each Airbnb, it contains reviews from all of its customers, detailed information about the place, and external links to that Airbnb website. This website also implements a simple login system that allows users to add reviews, and they are only able to modify and delete their own reviews.
